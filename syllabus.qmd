## Course description

This course introduces core issues and recent advances in urban economics. We develop canonical models to explain spatial regularities within and across cities and analyze the market forces that cause cities to grow. We then study housing, neighborhood effects, congestion, local government, segregation, violence, and disease. Along with lectures, lab sessions expose you to practical tools in data science such as data cleaning, visualization, and mapping using R. By the end of the semester, you will understand the economic approach to cities and be comfortable using R for urban data.

## Materials

### Required reading

You must be willing to spend time reading and thinking about the material. Lecture notes, articles, and code will be posted on the course website.

### Additional reading

There is no required textbook. However, class topics draw on chapters and papers from the following books. Reading is strongly recommended.

- Brueckner, J. K. (2011). *Lectures on Urban Economics*. MIT Press.
- Glaeser, E. (2011). *Triumph of the City*. Penguin Books.
- Moretti, E. (2012). *The New Geography of Jobs*. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.
- O’Sullivan, A. (2007). *Urban Economics*. McGraw-Hill/Irwin.
- Sampson, R. J. (2012). *Great American City: Chicago and the Enduring Neighborhood Effect*. University of Chicago Press.

### Required materials

You must have access to a computer where you can install up-to-date versions of R and RStudio. Prior programming experience is helpful but not required.

### Course Q&A

We will use a course discussion platform (TBD) to ask questions about course content and assignments. Participating regularly and helping classmates will be recognized as extra credit where appropriate.

## Prerequisites

Students must have completed intermediate microeconomics and regression analysis. An introductory course in applied econometrics is recommended but not required.

## Evaluation

### Grade determination

| Task | Weight |
| --- | ---: |
| Homework (5 assignments) | 40% |
| Midterm exam | 20% |
| Lab quiz | 20% |
| Final group project | 20% |
| Attendance, extra assignments, course participation | Up to 5% (extra credit) |

### Homework

Homework should be submitted online through the learning management system. Late assignments receive a daily penalty of 5% and may be submitted up to 3 days after the original deadline. After that, assignments receive no credit. Submit both the `.Rmd` and `.pdf` files. Points may be deducted for lack of organization in your report.

Students are encouraged to work together on homework. However, sharing, copying, or providing any part of a solution or code is an infraction of academic integrity policies and will be handled according to university rules.

### Midterm exam and lab quiz

The midterm exam and lab quiz are open book. Any interaction between students during the exam is an infraction of academic integrity policies. Exams must be completed during regular class time through the learning management system.

### Final project

There will be a final group project. Details will be posted on the course website.

### Conflicts and missed exams

Students must provide documentation for excused absences. In the event that a student misses the midterm exam, its weight will be redistributed to other tasks. There are no make-up exams.

### Grading scale

| Grade | Range | Grade | Range |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A+ | 97–100% | C+ | 77–79.99% |
| A | 93–96.99% | C | 73–76.99% |
| A- | 90–92.99% | C- | 70–72.99% |
| B+ | 87–89.99% | D+ | 67–69.99% |
| B | 83–86.99% | D | 63–66.99% |
| B- | 80–82.99% | D- | 60–62.99% |
| F | <59.99% |  |  |
