# Urban Economics datasets

These files support homework and lab activities. All datasets are hosted with the course site and can be downloaded directly.

## Core homework datasets

- `airbnb.RDS`
- `communities.xls`
- `chi_inc.RDS`
- `manufacturing.xls`
- `commute.rar` (shapefile archive)
- `kings_sales.RDS`
- `patentsUS`

## Notes

- Some files are compressed archives (`.rar`, `.zip`). Extract them before use.
- Shapefiles include multiple companion files (`.shp`, `.dbf`, `.shx`, `.prj`) that must stay together.
