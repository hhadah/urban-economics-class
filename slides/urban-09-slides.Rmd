# Motivation


.pull-left[

* We already saw many government policies that affect housing, such as land-use regulations and the tax subsidy to homeownership

* Now, we analyze additional public policies in the housing market: rent-control laws and housing-subsidy programs

* Rent control benefits current tenants in the short-term but has pervasive long-run effects on overall welfare 

* A less distortionary policy is to offer a subsidy to specific groups. However, each program involves opposing interests between the ones who finance the assistance (taxpayers) and the targeted group

# Rent Control

---
# How it works

* Rent-control laws typically limit the rate of rent's increase for a dwelling during a tenant's period of residence

  * When a new tenant moves in, the rent can be raised, but the subsequent rent increase is again restricted for the period of occupancy
  * New construction is usually exempt from rent control since "legislators do not want to discourage new development"
  
* Although rent control helps current tenants in the short run, there are many adverse effects associated with this policy 

  * Facing reduced profit, the landlord might want to cut costs, and one expense that can be lowered easily is maintenance. In other words, rent-controlled buildings are more likely to be dilapidated compared to uncontrolled buildings
  * Housing developers, expecting future changes in the law that would include newer buildings, have less incentive to construct new apartments
  * Households who live under controlled rent are less likely to move and give up their rent control, even if their housing needs change 

* Examples in Cambridge-MA and San Francisco-CA

# The Stock Flow Model

* The stock-flow model captures the distinction between the stock of housing and the flow of new construction

* The graph on the left - housing price `\(p\)` and quantity `\(H\)` - represents the stock side of the housing market (the supply curves `\(S\)`) and the aggregate demand for housing `\(D\)` 

.pull-left[ 

* The graph on the right represents the flow supply curve `\(S_{\Delta H}\)` and the net flow of new housing into the market `\(\Delta H\)`

* When the price is higher than the equilibrium `\(p_{e}\)`, there will be new construction, and the net flow `\(\Delta H\)` is positive. When  the price is lower than `\(p_{e}\)`, the net flow is negative: the supply of rental apartments is shrinking

# Demand Shocks 

* Suppose the economy starts in equilibrium (i.e., `\(p=p_{e}\)` and `\(H=H_{e}\)`), and is then subject to a demand shock - the demand curve moves from `\(D\)` to `\(D'\)`. According to the stock-flow model, there would be a spike in prices in the beginning since the housing stock does not respond immediately to the shock: `\(p_{e}\)` increases to `\(p'\)`

.pull-left[
* **The new price `\(p'\)` indicates scarcity** and, as time passes, m new constructions would be added to the former `\(H_{e}\)` stock of houses, bringing down the price until it again reaches `\(p_{e}\)`

* During the transition, existing residents suffer from higher housing costs. As a consequence, they may persuade the local government to impose a rent-control law immediately after the demand shock, limiting price to `\(p_{c}\)`

# Demand Shocks under Rent Control 

* To see how rent control affects new construction, assume that old and new buildings are subject to the new rent control law - prices cannot increase above `\(p_{c}\)`

* The rent control affects the market's response to the demand shock interfering in the signal of housing scarcity: prices

.pull-left[
* By keeping the price artificially low under conditions of high demand, the rent control prevents the developers from responding with an appropriately massive burst of new construction

* Eventually, the slow-growing housing stock reaches a size of `\(\hat{H}\)`. At that point, rent control does not bite anymore and the rental price, at last, reaches the equilibriu `\(p_{e}\)`

# Affordable Housing

---

# Overview
.pull-left[

* One justification for rent control is to help low-income renters. However, rent-control benefits are usually distributed in a highly unsystematic fashion

* Another way of reducing housing costs without interfering directly in prices is to subsidize consumption explicitly

* Besides, housing-subsidy programs may serve two goals: raise the standard of living of the targeted group and curb the negative externality associated with "slums"

* Given that twin focus, the following analysis considers two effects of subsidy programs: the **increase in the utility** of the targeted group (the rise in the standard of living), and the **slum-reduction effect**, i.e., the rise in housing consumption generated by the subsidy

]

.pull-right[

![](figs/uslum.jpg)

* Have in mind that the steady rise in rental prices is a signal, and another way to make rentals more affordable is to increase housing supply removing barriers to construction of housing for both high and low-income families.

# Proportional Rent Subsidy
* Consider households that maximize `\(U(c,q)\)` subject to a budget constraint `\(y=c+pq\)`

.pull-left[* The slope of the budget constraint is `\(\frac{dq}{dc}=-\frac{1}{p}\)`

* The low-income consumer maximizes his utility at the tangency point between his indifference curve and the budget line (points `\(q_{0}\)`, `\(c_{0}\)`)

* Assume that the government pays a fraction `\(\beta\)` of the household's rent bill `\(pq\)`. Now, the household pays only a fraction of the former bill, and his new budget constraint is `\(y=c+(1-\beta)pq\)`. The respective new slope is `\(\frac{dq}{dc}=-\frac{1}{(1-\beta)p}\)`

# Proportional Rent Subsidy


* The slope of the budget constraint is more negative, so the line gets steeper, rotating in the counterclockwise direction around its c intercept

.pull-left[
* The household can reach a higher utility level - effectively, housing prices are now lower (the government is subsidizing a fraction of the rent)

* Besides, the PRS program achieves slum reduction by increasing the household's consumption of housing from `\(q_{0}\)` to `\(q_{PRS}\)`

]




.pull-right[![](figs/fig3.png)]

# Income-Grant Program

* Now, consider a different kind of program: the government gives the low-income household an income grant `\(G\)`, not necessarily tied to housing consumption. Assume also that `\(G=\beta pq\)`, i.e., the income grant is equal to the PRS program in terms of benefits in $

.pull-left[
* The budget line is now `\(y+G=c+pq\)`, and it shifts in a parallel fashion, without changing the slope

* Both the consumption of housing `\(q\)` and bread `\(c\)` are now higher, and the consumer can reach a higher indifference curve

* The IG program yields to a higher utility level - households are free to choose the optimal quantities of `\(q\)` and `\(c\)`. On the other hand, the slum-reduction effect is higher under the PRS program

]


.pull-right[![](figs/fig4.png)]

---
# Housing Voucher Program

* Housing voucher is very similar to IG program: it involves giving low-income households vouchers to purchase housing `\(q\)`. Again, assume that `\(HV=G=\beta pq\)`. There will be a shift in a parallel fashion, but the consumption of `\(c\)` cannot be higher than `\(y\)` - the maximum amount that consumers could acquire in the original pre-subsidy situation. 

.pull-left[ * The resulted optimal consumption point is shown in the figure `\((q_{HV})\)`. When the household is free to choose his optimal consumption levels of `\(c\)` and `\(q\)`, he would like to consume `\(q_{IG}, c_{IG}\)`. Using the housing voucher, he cannot choose more bread than `\(y\)`, preventing him from moving onto the dashed segment 

* In this scenario, the `\(HV\)` program generates an outcome that lies between the `\(PRS\)` and the `\(IG\)` outcomes

# Public Housing Program

* Another type of subsidy is the provision of public housing. Basically, the government builds better housing units at below-market rents. Thus, households receive a dwelling instead of a financial transfer

.pull-left[
* Assume that the household pays the same rent to the government as he/she paid for his original unit where the housing consumption was `\(q_{0}\)`. Also, suppose that the government invested `\(G=HV=\beta pq\)` (same as the other subsidies) in building better dwellings

* Since the consumer is paying the same rent `\(pq\)` and getting the same income `\(y\)`, he will consume the same amount of `\(c\)` as in the pre-subsidy situation. 

* Because the government spends `\(G\)` per household in those new dwellings, the vertical movement of the budget line is the same as in the Income Grant or Housing Voucher programs. As a result, the household consumes the same old `\(c\)` and a new `\(q_{PH}\)`


]

.pull-right[![](figs/fig5.png)]

# Public Housing Program

.pull-left[ 

* One can see that the Public Housing program yields the most considerable slum-reduction effect of all the plans - `\(q_{PH}>q_{PRS}>q_{HV}>q_{IG}\)` -, **while generating the smallest increase in utility level**

* On the other hand, in terms of utility, `\(U_{IG}>U_{HV}>U_{PRS}>U_{PH}\)`

* Society's choice of a particular program would thus involve opposing interests
