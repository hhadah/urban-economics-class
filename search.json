We develop canonical models to explain spatial regularities within and across cities and analyze the market forces that cause cities to grow. We then study housing, neighborhood effects, congestion, local government, segregation, violence, and disease. Along with lectures, lab sessions expose you to practical tools in data science such as data cleaning, visualization, and mapping using R. By the end of the semester, you will understand the economic approach to cities and be comfortable using R for urban data."
