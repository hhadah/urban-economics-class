title: "Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA)"
---

## Overview

This lecture introduces exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) techniques for examining geographic patterns and spatial relationships in urban data. We'll learn about spatial autocorrelation, clustering, and visualization methods.
