title: "Rosen-Roback Model: Spatial Equilibrium"
---

## Overview

The Rosen-Roback model explains how workers and firms sort across cities based on wages, housing costs, and local amenities. This spatial equilibrium framework helps us understand why some cities have high wages and high costs while others offer different combinations.
